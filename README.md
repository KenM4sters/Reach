## Description
The purpose of this project is to keep the actual features very tight knit, and focus on quality over quantity. The ambition is to have a very simple scene with only a single object (either primitive or model), that users can modify from an ImGui window panel. Modifications will include switching out models, textures, shaders and lights, as well as simple transformations. 

While using OpenGL to start with, the project structure should also facilitate the use of the Vulkan API for learning purposes.

## Previous Project's Learning Outcomes (sandbox_engine)
- Experiment with static on key classes (Asset Managers && Camera?).
- Be consistent with smart pointers vs raw pointers.
- Use the `const` keyword whenever it's appropriate to (including in/after functions) - think like a Rust programmer (immutability first).
